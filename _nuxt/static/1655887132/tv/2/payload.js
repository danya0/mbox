Children \"practically do not differ from the rules of the adult\" Voice \". The first stage of the competition is \"blind\" auditions, in which 100 children from 7 to 14 years old, selected as a result of casting, take part. The members of the jury (they are also mentors) listen to the performances of the applicants, turning their backs to them. If the mentor likes the participant, he presses the red button, thereby expressing the desire to take the participant to his team. If all or several mentors have turned to the applicant, the participant has the right to choose with whom he wants to continue his path in the project. As a result of \"blind\" auditions, each of the three mentors recruits a team of 15 people."}}},mutations:[]});
