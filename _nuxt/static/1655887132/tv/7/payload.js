Experienced nutritionists and fitness trainers offer the heroes real tests of strength and will: players have to pull trucks at speed, catch piglets, build sugar pyramids, and dance samba. At the same time, they have complete freedom of action in terms of nutrition and sports. Each week, the team with the lowest weight loss chooses one player to leave the project. Only two remain in the final, and not only a slim figure, but also a cash prize awaits the winner."}}},mutations:[]});
