Among the program participants are well-known artists, Comedy Club residents, former KVN players and Slaughter League players, as well as novice comedians. Each of the participants in the show has his own image, which he uses with pleasure in his numbers. Stand Up comedians do not hesitate to make fun of themselves and the situations and people around us. They are jokers from the people who have their own opinion and the desire to express it in a humorous form."}}},mutations:[]});
